# Weather-Dashboard
####Kristabell Johnson

##### Why Built:
I built this dashboard to tell the weather in any city that is typed into the search bar.

##### Installation:
A repository was created in Github. As I worked I would push the information into Github.
Then I worked on the project and sent it up to git hub.

##### Usage:
First the user goes into the file and search a city of your choosing.
Then the user will get the results of the weather in the city they typed.
The user will also be able to check out the 5 day forecast.

##### Images:
1. Picture of the search bar website when it typed into search.
